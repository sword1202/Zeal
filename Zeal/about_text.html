Zeal is a service that allows user to collect and leverage existing loyalty programs with retailers. 
Zeal also enables the user to build their own loyalty based on the transactional history. 
Zeal analyses and presents the shopping data in a way that can be passed to a retailer in return for discounts or VIP treatment. See participating merchants. 
We encourage you to get your favorite retailer to sign up to the program. 

Thanks for your support.
